Typically, your phone provides you with a summary of notifications.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that prints the summary message based on the number of notifications that you received. The message should include:

The exact number of notifications when there are less than 100 notifications.
99+ as the number of notifications when there are 100 notifications or more.

Movie tickets are typically priced differently based on the age of moviegoers.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that calculates these age-based ticket prices:

A children's ticket price of $15 for people 12 years old or younger.
A standard ticket price of $30 for people between 13 and 60 years old. On Mondays, discount the standard ticket price to $25 for this same age group.
A senior ticket price of $20 for people 61 years old and older. Assume that the maximum age of a moviegoer is 100 years old.
A -1 value to indicate that the price is invalid when a user inputs an age outside the age specifications.

There are three main temperature scales used in the world: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that converts a temperature from one scale to another with these formulas:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: 째 F = 9/5 (째 C) + 32
Kelvin to Celsius: 째 C = K - 273.15
Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = 5/9 (째 F - 32) + 273.15
Note that the String.format("%.2f", /* measurement */ ) method is used to convert a number into a String type with 2 decimal places.
*//*Imagine that you need to create a music-player app.

Create a class that can represent the structure of a song. The Song class must include these code elements:

Properties for the title, artist, year published, and play count
A property that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.
A method that prints a song description in this format:
"[Title], performed by [artist], was released in [year published]." */
